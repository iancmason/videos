# Code For The Imposter's Handbook Videos, Seasons 1 and 2

This is the code for the "CS Basics" video series, otherwise known as "The Imposter Video Series". They started out as individual offerings but in late 2020 I combined them into a single video set [which you can see more of right here](https://bigmachine.io/productions/imposter-video).

If you have any issues with the code or videos, feel free to leave an issue!
